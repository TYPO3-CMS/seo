"Missing Meta Description" widget
=================================

..  versionadded:: 12.2
    The widget "Missing Meta Description" was added.

To make it more convenient for TYPO3 editors to optimize their website for search
engines, :composer:`typo3/cms-seo` offers a dashboard widget that shows pages without
a meta description.

The description field is important for SEO purposes. This field is used to
instruct search engines to use this text to show as a teaser of your page in
the search result snippets. With this description, you can give the user a
clear overview of the topic of this page:

..  image:: ../Images/google-preview.png
    :class: with-shadow
    :width: 600px
    :alt: Google result preview
